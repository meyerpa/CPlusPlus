BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog1'.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog1' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program contains and tests the Currency class.

PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes from main.cpp.
	
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to the screen. It will show the result of operations
      used in main and print the currency.
	
PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program contains and tests the Currency class.
      - It tests the constructor, relational operators,
	assignment operator, multiplication, division, 
	addition, and subtraction operators. It also tests
	the extration and insertion operators. It then tests
	the setFormat method.

   Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
   be found in the documentation for each file. For the currency class,
   it can be foudn in currency.h.
