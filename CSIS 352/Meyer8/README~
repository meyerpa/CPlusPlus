BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog8'.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog8' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program contains and tests the hash class. The hash class
   uses a hash chain. On a side note, I used the old hash 
   program because I already finished it the first day, and I thought
   my time should be dedicated to preparing for the exam.

PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes from main.cpp. It doesn't ask for any user input.
	
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to the screen. It will show the result of operations
      used in main and print those or the hash object.
	
PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program contains and tests the Hash class.
      - It tests the constructors and methods.

   Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
   be found in the documentation for each file. For the Hash class,
   it can be found in hash.h.
