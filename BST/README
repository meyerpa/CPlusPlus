BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog7'.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog7' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program contains and tests the sortedlist class.

PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes from main.cpp and the screen. 
   It asks for nodes in the tree and inserts them 
   until the user enters 0.
	
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to the screen. It will show the result of operations
      used in main and print those or the sortedlist object.
	
PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program contains and tests the Graph and Vertex classes.
      - It tests the constructors and methods.

   Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
   be found in the documentation for each file. For the SortedList class,
   it can be found in SortedList.h.
