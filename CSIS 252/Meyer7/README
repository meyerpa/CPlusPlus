BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog7'.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog7' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program will take names and ages(int) from a file called data up to
   20 people long. It will then output those names in age ascending order
   to the screen.

PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes from the the file calle data. The program will read until
   twenty names and ages(int). Input has to be name first then on the next line
   the age as an integer return character, then repeat for up to 20 people. 
   An example is below.

      Helga
      6
      
   
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to a file called output. From the example input above,
   the output is:
	NAME                AGE
	-----------------------
	Helga                 6
	Paige Meyer          20
	Harry Henders        34
	Olga Anderson        80

      

PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program stores all the data in an array of people(struct).

   The general algorithm
      Read from file and insert data to struct.
      Insert struct into list
      Iterate above two steps while still data in data file
      Sort array accoring to age, ascendingly
      Print formatted array
      
    

   Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
   be found in the documentation for each file.

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested with different sets of data.  
      
      With over 20 names and ages
      
      With names separated with spaces and commas
      
      With people of the same age
      
      With an empty data file, so no people
