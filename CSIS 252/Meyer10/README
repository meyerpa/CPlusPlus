BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog10'.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog10' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program will take max score, names, and scores recieved from a file called people up to
   20 people long. It will then output those names in ascending order with respect to age
   to the screen.

PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes from the the file typed on the command line. The program will read until
   twenty names and ages(int). Input has to be name first then on the next line
   the age as an integer return character, then repeat for up to 20 people. 
   An example is below.

PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to a file called as designated. From the example input above,
   the output is:

PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program stores all the data in a orderedList of studentType(class).

   The general algorithm
      Read from file and insert data to studentType.
      Insert studentType into the orderedList
      Iterate above two steps while still data in people file
      Sort array accoring to score
      Print formatted array
      
    

   Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
   be found in the documentation for each file.

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested with different sets of data.  
      
      With over 15 students
      
      With people of the same score
      
      With an empty data file
