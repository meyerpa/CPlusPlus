BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog8'.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog8' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program will take names and birthdays(dateTypes) from a file called people up to
   10 people long. It will then output those names in age ascending order
   to the screen.

PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes from the the file calle data. The program will read until
   twenty names and ages(int). Input has to be name first then on the next line
   the age as an integer return character, then repeat for up to 20 people. 
   An example is below.
      Maria
      2/3/1995
      Fern
      3/4/2001
      Olga
      2/4/2001
      Jerry
      3/2/2001
      
   
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to a file called output. From the example input above,
   the output is:
	NAME                      BIRTHDAY 
	------------------------- ----------
	Fern                      3/4/2001
	Jerry                     3/2/2001
	Olga                      2/4/2001
	Maria                     2/3/1995


      

PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program stores all the data in an array of personType(class).

   The general algorithm
      Read from file and insert data to personType.
      Insert personType into list
      Iterate above two steps while still data in people file
      Sort array accoring to age, ascendingly
      Print formatted array
      
    

   Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
   be found in the documentation for each file.

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested with different sets of data.  
      
      With over 15 names and birthdays
      
      With people of the same birthday
      
      With an empty data file, so no people
