BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog11'.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog11' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program will take a infix expression and convert it to postfix expression.

PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes the screen. The program will read one line for the expression.
   An example is below.
      (a-b)/w^3+3/2
      
   
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to the screen. From the example input above,
   the output is:
	Infix notation: (A-B)/W^3+3/2
	Postfix expresion: AB-W3^/32/+


      

PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program stores all the data in queues. When sorting from infix to 
   postfix it uses a stack and a queue to finally get the infix queue to
   postfix queue.

   The general algorithm
      Read from the screen an infix expression and insert into queueType.
      Print the infix expression
      Change from infix to post-fix.
      print the post fix queueType.
      
    

   Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
   be found in the documentation for each file.

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested with different sets of data.  
      
      With various infix expressions:
	   (a-b)/w^3+3/2
	   (4/3)+5/4^3
	   (3+4)/3^5
	   2+3
	   2/3+4/3
	   4/a^b

      With no infix expression (just a return character)
