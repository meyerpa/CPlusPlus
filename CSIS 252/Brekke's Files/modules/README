BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program will read ints from the keyboard, output them, sort
   them ascendingly, then output them again. 

PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes from the keyboard.  The program will read until the
   sentinel value 0 is entered. Input can be entered all on one line,
   or separate lines, or a combination of the two.
   For example:
      5
      4 6
      3 0
   
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to the screen.  The output will be the original
   array as entered from the keyboard and the result of the sorted array.
   For example:
      array: 5 4 6 3 
      sorted array: 3 4 5 6 

PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program stores all the ints in an array.

   The general algorithm
      read the ints into an array
      output the array
      sort the array
      output the array

   Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
   be found in the documentation for each file.

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested with different sets of data.  

   Checked for a normal set of data partially filling the array
   
   Checked for the number of values exceeding the array size
   
   Checked for input of 1 value and the sentinel

   Checked for input of just the sentinel

   There are no known bugs.  Any errors should be reported to:
