BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog12'.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog12 and filename' at the command prompt after building the program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
   This program will take a file of phonebook entries.

PROGRAM INPUT
   All input comes the screen or a fiile. The program will have a menu option to display/save, add
   a new entry, and delete an entry.
	
      
      
   
PROGRAM OUTPUT
   All output is written to the screen or file. From the example input above,
   the output is:
	paige3;234-234-2342
	paige;234-234-2342



      

PROGRAM DESIGN
   This program stores all the data in queues. When sorting from infix to 
   postfix it uses a stack and a queue to finally get the infix queue to
   postfix queue.

   The general algorithm
      Read from the screen an infix expression and insert into queueType.
      Print the infix expression
      Change from infix to post-fix.
      print the post fix queueType.
      
    

   Function input and output, preconditions and postconditions can
   be found in the documentation for each file.

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested with different sets of data.  
      
      With empty file

      With bad file name
